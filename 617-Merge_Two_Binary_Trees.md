### 617 Merge Two Binary Trees

Easy

Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.

You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
	Tree 1                     Tree 2                  
          1                         2                             
         / \                       / \                            
        3   2                     1   3                        
       /                           \   \                      
      5                             4   7                  
Output: 
Merged tree:
	     3
	    / \
	   4   5
	  / \   \ 
	 5   4   7
```

 

**Note:** The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.



**Solution**

用DFS，如果碰到兩個節點都存在，則相加；如果其中一個不存在，return另一個

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeTrees(self, t1: TreeNode, t2: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if t1 is None:
            return t2
        if t2 is None:
            return t1
        
        t1.val += t2.val
        t1.left = self.mergeTrees(t1.left, t2.left)
        t1.right = self.mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right)
        
        return t1
```
